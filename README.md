# The Axiom

The Axiom serves as the principal blog of [**@quantum9Innovation**](https://github.com/quantum9innovation).
Development is powered mainly by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo template](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/). Site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://quantum9innovation.github.io/axiom/). This README is nothing special; the actual content is located in the [content](/content/) directory.

## Building

To run this blog locally (perhaps to edit or make corrections), you need to have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed.
Next, fire up a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*  # allow executing scripts
scripts/start.sh
```

You only need to run the first command once.
The second command will enable hot-reloading and display all draft articles as well. Refer to the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for more information (such as hosting on specific URLs).
