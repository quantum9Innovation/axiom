# The Axiom

The Axiom serves as the principal blog of @quantum9Innovation.
Development is powered mainly by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Congo template](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/). Site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://quantum9innovation.github.io/axiom/). This README is nothing special; the actual content is located in the [content](/content/) directory.
